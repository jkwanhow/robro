Ice Melts Lyrics[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
Nigga, what you thought?
Slatt, slatt, slatt
Jeffery (Mario)
Jeffery, ayy
Yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Feel a rump-rump
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin', somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin', somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give luck to someone
You need to fuckin' stop watchin' me
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Jeffery)
[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I want you to myself
But I know you just left someone else, I know you did
He did a number on you (I know, brrrt)
That must be why you move so... icy

[Bridge: Drake]
Icy like 1017
Icy like there's nobody youâ€™d ever need
Better not give that up to anyone but me (yeah)
Patient as can be, but

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything, somehow

[Chorus: Young Thug, Young Thug & Drake]
Feel a rump-rump
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin', somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin', somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give luck to someone
You need to fuckin' stop watchin' me
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Jeffery)
[Verse 2: Drake]
I wanna see you do more in this life if we takin' it there (Takin' it)
I want to see you do 911, fuck a Panamera (In a 911)
See you when I see the real thing, gettin' realer and realer (Real)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Drake]
But you icy like 1017 (Icy)
Icy like there's nobody you'd ever need (Icy, icy)
Better not give that up (Better not give that up)
I'm here patient as can be, man

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything somehow
