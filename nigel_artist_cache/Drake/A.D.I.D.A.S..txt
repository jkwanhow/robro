A.D.I.D.A.S. Lyrics[Chorus: Perrie, All]
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You, ooh-ooh, ooh)
They say that it's overrated, well, they ain't doing it right (Ahh)
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You, ooh-ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: Jesy, All]
Since I met you I been thinking all day
I been Googling ways to keep you entertained
It's been three weeks since we started to play
Now it's serious, babe, 'cause what you do is crazy
[Pre-Chorus: Perrie, Jesy, All]
I never had somebody who
Could do them things, make me say "ooh, ooh, ooh" (Ah!)
So come on, baby, baby, come on, pretty baby
You're gonna get it tonight (Oh)

[Chorus: Jesy, All, Jesy & Jade, Jesy & Perrie]
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You, ooh-ooh, ooh)
They say that it's overrated, well, they ain't doing it right (No)
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You, ooh-ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Jade, All]
Slavin' in the kitchen, iced you a cake
Then I served you a plate, but that ain't what you ate, no
We've been busy doing all Fifty Shades
While we listen to Drake, we on that hot love and emotion

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne, All]
I never had somebody who
Could do them things, make me say "ooh, ooh, ooh"
So come on, baby, baby, come on, pretty baby
You're gonna get it tonight

[Chorus: All, Jade, Jade & Perrie, Jesy]
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You, ooh-ooh, ooh)
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You, ooh-ooh, ooh)
They say that it's overrated, well they ain't doing it right (No)
All day I dream about (Shh) with you
(You, ooh-ooh, ooh; That's right, that's right)
[Bridge: Jesy, Leigh-Anne, Jade, Perrie, (All)]
You got that goodie-goodie (Uh-huh) and I'm addicted
I'm on that kissy-kissy, bang, bang (Bang, bang) delicious
All day I dream about it (What?), baby, so how's about it?
You know I'm all about that
All day I dream about— (Wait), all day I dream about— (Wait!)
All day I dream about (Shh) (With you!)

[Verse 3: Leigh-Anne, All]
Excuse me, do me or lose me
Get me to the bedroom, do your duty
Milkshake, milkshake
Bet you like some of that strawberry
Like a wave gonna come, tsunami
Wanna take this ride, better hurry
'Cause me one, you there's a million
And they all wanna, huh, my Brazilian (Haha!)

[Outro: Leigh-Anne, All, Leigh-Anne & Perrie]
They say that it's overrated, well, they ain't doing it right (No)
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You, ooh-ooh, ooh)23Embed
