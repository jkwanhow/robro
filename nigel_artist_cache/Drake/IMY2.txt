IMY2 Lyrics[Intro: Juice WRLD]
I think that's what life is about
Truly findin' yourself
And then closin' your eyes and dyin' in your sleep

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi & Drake]
Lifted are my days, my dreams are vivid colors (Woo)
The jet is low, they make me take your trips, we fly by (Let's go)
No stress is on my brain, no worries here, I'm chosen (Yeah, yeah)
Made another way, my nigga, watch me go shine
When I close my eyes my world comes alive (Yeah)
La-la-la-la-la-la
People grow, good times sometimes (Nigga)
Real niggas in life survive (Yeah)
And I'm sailing to the edge of my mind
Nigga, double up life (Yeah, yeah)
Set the tempo, got a nympho on my line (Yeah-yeah)
Said she wanna unwind (She do)
And I'm focused on gettin' more
They too stuck on gettin' even, I'm ready for it
We should really be together more
'Cause I know we got some time but I'm never sure
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Catch me ten-toes in the limelight (Yeah)
Fuck the world up, on my life, right (Nigga)
Sayin' I'm the one, she lie, lie
She checkin' for me, now baby come in my dreams, my dreams (Yeah)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Hey-ayy, hey-ayy, hey-yeah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah, woah

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Kid Cudi]
Finding myself as the days
Fly by like us on the move
You told me I was a phase
Okay, fine, I miss you too
Probably wouldn't believe me if I told you
Pieces of myself that I should never lose
All these people that love you don't know you
How am I supposed to move?
Hey-ayy, hey-ayy, hey-yeah
How am I supposed to move?

[Verse 2: Drake]
All my niggas rally 'round me
Bold niggas gettin' real italics 'round me
Finally circled, found the purple
Undisclosed amounts straight from Universal
Too commercial, 'leven years later I done found my purpose
Here I am, oh, they mad
Goin' out swingin' for 'em, goin' out sad
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Catch me ten-toes in the limelight (Yeah)
Fuck the world up, on my life, right (Nigga)
Sayin' I'm the one, she lie, lie
She checkin' for me, now baby come in my dreams, my dreams (Yeah)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Hey-ayy, hey-ayy, hey-yeah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah, woah

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Finding myself as the days
Fly by like us on the move
You told me I was a phase
Okay, fine, I miss you too
Probably wouldn't believe me if I told you
Pieces of myself that I should never lose
All these people that love you don't know you
How am I supposed to move?

[Outro: Drake]
Gettin' more
We should really be together more
But I'm never sure21Embed
