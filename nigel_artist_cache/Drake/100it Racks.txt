100it Racks Lyrics[Intro: Future]
Southside
Summer '16! Yeah!
Freebandz, OVO
DJ Esco
Talkin' duffle talk, yeah

[Chorus: Future & Drake]
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
And I, I got a...
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
[Verse 1: Drake]
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
All y'all niggas don't matter
I hit threes off-balance
I switch hands like Allen
I'm just blessed, full of talent
For the whole 6, I'm wildin'
You think she your baby girl
She text us like Dallas
Oh, shit, guess it don't matter
Talk down on me, I'm flattered
Whole Freebandz on Xanax
Y'all can't do no damage
Wrong cup, guess it don't matter
This one tastes like candy
This one must be Hendrix
Fuck y'all boys, y'all finished
You're dead!
I don't talk to hoes about business
Diamond in my tooth from the dentist
Put a nigga name in the Guinness
'Member when my phone was on minutes
I ain't dead yet like I'm Bruce Willis
I ain't really worried 'bout a image
Y'all still treat it like a scrimmage
[Chorus: Future, Drake & 2 Chainz]
And I, I got a...
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper (Geez!)
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
I, I got a... (DJ Esco!)
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper (Yeah!)
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper (Why not? Haha)
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper (Okay)
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper (Okay)
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper (Okay)
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper (Truuu!)
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper (2 Chainz!)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Hundred thousand bustin' out the wrapper (Ugh!)
Count it up 'til I get a callous (Ugh!)
I don't really talk to y'all rappers (Mm!)
Put codeine in a Snapple (Ugh!)
Put codeine on a salad (Salad)
Guess I'm on a codeine diet (Diet)
Put another hundred in the rifle (Rifle)
Everybody better be quiet, uh (Shhhh)
Everybody put your hands higher (Higher!)
Then I chop the top like, "Hi-yah," woo!
All of my 16s fire, ooh
All of my bitches bi-ah
They buyin' extra clothes, I mean
They bisexual, I mean
Versace sectional, I mean
Roll up the Texaco, I mean
This is the crazy flow
I got a straitjacket in the booth (Ugh)
I smoke a joint durin' an interview (Ugh)
Got the Rolex playin' peek-a-boo (Ugh, ugh)
All of you niggas that took the swag (Ugh!)
I'ma have to get residuals (Ugh!)
I'm a different individual (Ugh!)
Got my hand on my genitals (Ugh!)
[Chorus: Future & Drake]
I got a...
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
And I, I got a...
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
Got a hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper

[Verse 3: Future]
We ain't gotta use no scale (Yeah)
It's all there, you ain't gotta count it (Yeah)
Crocodile Herm√®s bag (Bag)
Stuffed all down my pockets (Whoa)
Hundred racks sittin' in the plastic (Plastic)
I ain't gon' even fuckin' touch it (Touch it)
You can go ask L.A. (Lay)
I don't go to work on budgets (Ugh)
You can go check these stones (Stones)
Everything on me flooded (Flooded)
And I gotta work three phones (Phones)
Name another nigga gettin' cloned (Cloned)
Put a hoe nigga on a shirt (Shirt)
Got a new bank account alert ('Lert)
Whole Freebandz on mud (Mud)
Taliban gang on Percs (Percs)
I ain't gonna take no shots (Shots)
Turn my dog to a boss (Boss)
We ain't gon' take no losses (Nah)
Know you tryna steal that sauce (Sauce)
Hundreds on hundreds on hundreds (Hundreds)
I done ran up me a bag (Bag)
We got a tour this summer (Summer)
I'm 'bout to run up a bag (Yeah)
Hundred thousand dollars for a walkthrough (Hundred)
I'ma need mine in cash (Hundred)
Got a whole city on my back (Yeah)
I ain't 'bout to go outside
Whole Freebandz on go
