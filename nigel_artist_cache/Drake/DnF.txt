DnF Lyrics[Intro: P. Reign & Future]
P. Reign! Reps Up!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Drake & Future]
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
[Verse 1: P. Reign]
Life is great when you’re naked
You press the gas, and I brake it
I drink liquor, don’t chase it
And I get women, don’t chase ‘em
I put her face in the pillow
And watch her bite on the blanket
See you tempted to taste it
Get every drop and don’t waste it
I’m fucking with you, I’m fucking with you
The type of dick to make a white girl say, ‘’I love that nigga’’
I hit your Instagram and click "Like" on, like, every picture
You get it from your momma?
Well, then, bring your momma with you—
And lots of liquor
Tell he, "fuck me like you hate me"
"You love me?" I said, "maybe"
She said, "Boy don't keep me waiting"
I say, "go down, don't be lazy," yeah
Now, that's my baby, that's my baby
She love me for my drive
I love her 'cause she drive me crazy—what's up?

[Hook: Drake & Future]
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress, tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck
Drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck
Drunk and fuck, drunk
[Verse 2: Drake]
OVO, I ride; OMO, I ride
Reps-Up, them my niggas from the Scarborough side
Don’t fuck with them, or hollow tips will fly
I don’t have to lie
Lot of people say it in a song just to say it
Man, I’m not that type of guy; hit me on the cell
I just might bring you to the city
Send you home with stories you can never tell
I’m tryna break you out of your shell
(And what?) You just turned 21 like Adele
That’s good with me; I put my business on hold
Let me turn off the phone, let’s explore the unknown
If you not drinking with me, you force me to turn up alone
No peer pressure, I just know you like to get in your zone
You say that you’d rather smoke
Well, let me call up OB’s room and tell him, "Roll up a cone"
I know he probably got that extra special (Yup)
I never second-guess it
"How's Villanova? What classes you taking next semester?"
Man, she like, "Fuck the small talk
I’m not here to discuss extra credits or my professors"
No time for funny stories
It’s funny how she shows up late, but always comes before me
We both young and misguided, but that’s another story, yeah
[Hook: Drake & Future]
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs

But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck
Drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck
Drunk and fuck, drunk186Embed
