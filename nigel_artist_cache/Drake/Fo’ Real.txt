Fo’ Real Lyrics[Intro]
Freebandz, the movie

[Chorus: Future]
It's over twenty-five girls in my section
Lets make a movie tonight, you won't regret it (You won't regret it)
Fo real, for real (Yeah)
You know the money bring the cars (And what?)
He cars bring the hoes (What's up?)
Rockstar life, that's how it goes (Future Hendrixx)
Fo real, for real (We in this motherfuckin' line right here)
(Nigga, 'lil Mexico shit, Freebandz, we global now, nigga)
[Bridge: Future]
Who got that drink, hell yeah, who got that drink?
They wanna pop champagne, yeah, they wanna drink (They wanna drink)
Fo real, for real

[Verse 1: Future]
They wish they was rockstars like us (And what?)
I bet you they wish they could get fly like us (Freebandz)
The same gang of niggas in here with money on us (Freebandz)
We got them mollies in here, they mix that Xan and that Tuss (Drank up)
Ain’t go to church this Sunday but I had church
I paid my tithes with them strippers, bought the bitch a purse (And what?)
I’m on a whole 'nother planet, never on the Earth (Pluto)
I brought my whole hood with me and we goin’ berserk ('Lil Mexico)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Even though I used to act, man, this shit is not a act, nigga
I have never lied on a track, only facts, nigga
A lot of people willin’ to back that, and if you backtrack
I spoke about this comin’ to fruition in my raps, nigga
Yeah, then it happened, nigga, wassup, nigga?
You just jealous, you just bitter, shut the fuck up
This that I’ve been on the roll shit, I’m back on my old shit
416, we know your bitch, that Free Band OVO shit, fo’ real

[Verse 3: Future]
I-I be splurgin’, Christian Dior, I got Chanel on order (Splurge)
I met that girl and had to spoil her ‘cause that girl’s so loyal (I gots)
I met her when she was a dime and turned into a quarter (Turn up)
We drank champagne just like it’s water, drink that lean like water
They told me hold back, that’s when I went hard (That's when I went hard)
I bought some guns, I bought some ice and bought some more lawyers
You try and take what I done sacrificed and worked hard for
I’m in that mode, I’m in that zone like when a nigga raw (Yee)
I’m celebratin’ every day, goddamn it I could be starvin’ (I couldn't be starvin')
Let’s have a toast to all my niggas runnin’ up in apartments (Let's have a toast)
We had a good year this year, we made a lot of fortunes (Bankroll)
And we very fortunate (Woo, woo, woo)
[Bridge: Future]
Who got that drink, hell yeah who got that drink (Freebandz)
They wanna pop champagne, yeah they wanna drink
Fo real, fo real8Embed
