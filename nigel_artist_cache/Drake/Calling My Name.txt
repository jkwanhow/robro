Calling My Name Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy
Ayy

[Chorus]
Mmm, what do I want?
Why is it so hard giving you up?
I'm countin' the days 'til you come
I'm countin' the ways to make you
Mmm, what do I want?
Why is it so hard giving you up?
I'm countin' the days 'til you come
I'm countin' the ways to make you
[Verse]
You're my water, my refresher
Take off your clothes, relieve pressure
I need your touch when I'm with her
My heart, it beats different rhythm

[Interlude]
Killa cut, blood
Killa cut, blood
Killa cut, blood
Killa cut, blood

[Interlude]
Your pussy is calling my name
So come on, baby, let's stop playing games
Your pussy is calling my name
So come on, baby, let's stop playing games

[Outro]
Your pussy is calling my name
So come on, baby, let's stop playing games
Your pussy is calling my name
So come on, baby, let's stop playing games, games1Embed
