Wildfire (OVO Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, oh, nah, I'm ready
Yeah, let's go
Your girlfriend at my next show, OVOXO, nigga
Haha, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, what's up?
Real nigga doin' real stuff
Get a lot of money, you can never get enough
And you know the new shit sound so tough
So-and-so just walked in, so what?
I don't really vibe with a lot of these niggas
I ain't really into givin' more than one chance
Girl, I already tried with a lot of these niggas, fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that?
That can't be from here
That can't be what they believin' is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit, that's that fake shit, that's that top row of veneers
Just when they gettin' impatient's when I make it world premier
Aww, damn, word, award shows coming?
Make sure you spell the shit right
Make sure to gimme all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff's still in that Sprite
They watch us, make the shit into a song
You ain't living that boy, stop stealin' that light
Anything can happen when I do see y'all
Guess it all depends how I'm feelin' that night, okay
Live my life in hotels, bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend, bitch better have my tomb right, ahh
This is perfect for the women that I've loved before
I love 'em all, I just love me more, huh
[Verse: Yukimi Nagano]
I could bet all of the riches that I ever had
Rushing the night like a shark, babe, would it be bad?
If I had to set the alarm 'cause of the thrills that run up my back
You are my star, nothing else can lead me off track

[Chorus: Yukimi Nagano & SBTRKT]
Hey-yeah, you're like a wildfire
You got me rising high
Your innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime, if you don't
You'll expire by the throat
