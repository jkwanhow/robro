Big Mood Lyrics[Verse 1: Drake]
Wisdom tooth, got Perc' in my system
I've been buyin' Birkins in rhythm
Save 'em for my wife when I get her
Right now, not the season for givin'
Bossin' up the city, that's a big mood
Niggas we don't even fuck with gettin' Ms too
But just know we could cut that off again too
Sparkle up the wrist, now that's a big mood

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, things going my way, big mood
Exotic up the driveway, big mood
Double up the contract, big mood
If we don't have no contact, then we ain't cool
Had to hit up Jimmy, hit up Mike and tell 'em double
Triple, double, Chubbs is hoodied up, I feel like Russell
Baka, he a star, but still around to burst a bubble
Bitch, you crazy, don't pull up at 3 AM to cuddle
[Verse 2: Drake]
'Member when I used to go to clubs and pay the cover
Bitch, this not Fugazi, but my neck still changin' color
You haven't found another 'cause there ain't another
I break down a hunnid bag and give it to my cousin, ayy
Cashville, I got bands still like a boss
All they do is PR double-E me like I'm Dolph
They say "holy" when they see the chain, that's not a cross
Put the owl on it, you can never take it off

[Verse 3: Future]
Wisdom tooth, I'm pimpin' like Goldie
Brand new Phantom cost me ten Rollies
I've been buyin' rings like I'm Kobe (Pluto!)
Fuck Trump, that's for my woadies (Gang, gang)
Bossin' up the gang, that's a big mood
Niggas we don't fuck with get them bags too
I think you should know you can get whacked too
Pinky ring splash like a swimmin' pool
King Pluto, might as well nail me to the cross
All I do is run my bands up like I don't walk
I get Boosie in the Lamborghini, wipe me off
Cashville, I got racks still, fuck the law
Presidential suite filled with Birkin
Wisdom tooth got Mollies and Perkies
Fuckin' with my gang and get murdered
Shout out to my city, they murder
All-All I did was boss up the city, that's my fault
You not touched a hunnid Ms, I don't wanna talk
Shut yo mouth, you talkin' too basic
We put yo BM in rotation
Shit, niggas woulda did the same thing if it was me
King Pluto, I gave all my exes to the streets
King Pluto, I got pink diamonds on my teeth
Pink weddin' ring on my pinkie too
I got slimes with me, they got sticks too
I got nine bitches, I got fifty coupes
I got nine main bitches, I got fifty coupes
They say "holy" when they see my chain, it's not a cross
[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, things going my way, big mood
Exotic up the driveway, big mood
Double up the contract, big mood
If we don't have no contact, then we ain't cool
Had to hit up Jimmy, hit up Mike and tell 'em double
Triple, double, Chubbs is hoodied up, I feel like Russell
Baka, he a star, but still around to burst a bubble
Bitch, you crazy, don't pull up at 3 AM to cuddle
