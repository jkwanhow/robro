Lie To Me Lyrics[Intro: Pimp C]
Man, get the fuck away from us, we don't want nothin' but money
We some family men, we gettin' this paper
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
And I had to put that out there, Bun
Because a lot of niggas doin' lot of Fugazi shit out here, man

[Chorus]
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
[Verse]
All you do is lie to me
And dub me, you never love me
Any confidence I came with, you take it from me
I just wanna get beside you and make you love me
I just can not take the silence, you keep ignorin' me
See you makin' all this time for more important things
We was s'posed to catch a vibe the other night
Busy now, but you was down that other time
Why you always lead me on and give me signs?
I just wanna get beside and make you mine
I just wanna come inside and reunite
Got me waitin' outside (Hah)

[Chorus]
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell

[Outro: Diddy]
Uhm, you was just so in your pocket, uhm
Cats used to tell me when they used to come to my house in Miami and shit
That, that, that they felt a feelin' of like
They felt a lil' fucked up in they stomach
But, they was inspired 'cause they knew they, they, they had somethin' to see the dream for, you know?
I done seen a lot of shit, I ain't never seen a, a young nigga as consistent as you that has affected the world in such a positive way since, you know, Michael Jackson
And then, when you've finally got the crib (All you do is lie to me)
You did it like, not even none of us did it, you feel me? Uhm
Nah, I mean I did it like that, I ain't gon' lie, I ain't gon' lie to you
I did it like that, but, I ain't never been affected by another nigga crib in the way that did it to inspire me
How cats told me that he'd been inspired (All you do is lie to me)
And felt that feelin' in they gut, like "I gotta work harder" (Need more than a homie)
Well I mean workin' harder just to compete, bro, for real, for real
It's either you fuckin' in the game or you're out the game
Nigga, I'm back in this motherfucker, let's get some money
It's over, nigga, you have arrived, top five, end of discussion
May God bless you, Inshallah, you know what I'm sayin'?
This your brother, Diddy, take that
And thank you for the inspiration, jheeze4Embed
