Outta Time Lyrics[Verse 1: Drake]
I've been thinkin' maybe
Things were never the
Way we made 'em out to be
How we thought they were
Lately, I'm not sure
One thing for sure
Is when we're together
We're toxic as ever
Make no mistake, all the roads lead
To we shouldn't be together
[Chorus: Drake]
I don't know why I
Still play into your palm
Even though I know what you want
Been twisted off you so long, oh-ho
'Cause it's complicated, far from simple
Always find a way to dodge thеse issues
Can't seem to shake it, not for nothing
Thе problem is we're not discussin'
All that screaming, yelling's not becomin' of you
Things just can't be fixed, we're out of time

[Bridge: Bryson Tiller]
Time, oh yeah
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Oh, turns out I don't
Know, know you, no, not anymore, no
And I can't wait 'til we find a way to part ways
Seems like your days are dark days
Seems like you're mad at the small things, I
Admit it, it seems like you're playin' it the hard way
We fight through the night, all day
[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
I, I still don't know why I
Still play into your palm
Even though I know what you want
I've been twisted on you for so long
For so long, girl (Yeah, yeah)
Got me twisted, I could only wait for so long
For so long, girl (For so long)
Waited so long, but we got no time, no

[Outro: Bryson Tiller]
Ooh, babe
Woah, oh
Woah, oh no
Ooh, babe
Woah, oh
Woah, oh no8Embed
