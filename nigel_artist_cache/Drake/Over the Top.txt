Over the Top Lyrics[Intro: Smiley & Drake]
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Prada and Gucci, it don't go together
Louis and Dior, I swear it go better
He wearin' my drip, but I wear it better
Kilani gang, I swear he go wetter
Huh? Gang
On go mode, I should get a chain for the promo
(Ayy)
Gang, gang, gang
[Chorus: Drake]
The level is just too advanced
The bezel is Tiffany stamped
Don't grip on my hand
I know that I came with a slide from left to right, but now I don't wanna dance
I got too much on the line, too much on my mind, too much ain't enough for my plans
Nike don't pay me to tell you, "Just do it"
They pay me to show you I'll do it again

[Post-Chorus: Smiley]
Huh? Yeah
I'm in control of the block (Live)
You know how October get hot (You know)
Might make this glizzy go pop (Bang)
The crib is over the top (It is)
The whip is over the top (How?)
I thought about letting her go (I did)
But I wasn't over the top

[Verse 1: Drake]
I can't be pale in my casket
Make sure I die with a tan, it's part of the brand
I know that I came with a slide from left to right, but now I don't wanna dance
Cannot depend on the man
I slide her some bread in a jam, that's just who I am
Customs just wavin' at us from the window
They don't even come on the plane when we land
Anyone else would retire, but I'm not content
I wanna bury these niggas like twenty feet down so no one can find them again
It's gotta be scary to witness me carry these niggas around in both of my hands
They stay inviting me over, they say they got bitches
I get there and then it's just them
[Verse 2: Smiley]
Got a verse from the boy and it leaked (Fuck)
He sent me a new one, said use it instead (Use it)
Everything good when you live in the hills
Got a chef and maid for a bed (Wow)
Can you imagine the shit that I seen?
I went from the Roy to the South to my dreams
The bridge got burnt and it shattered (Fuck)
I'm climbing, I don't need a ladder
New year, it's a new chapter (New)
Got her Snap and I didn't even Snap her (I didn't)
She wanna fuck out of anger (She wack)
Back in the days, life was so hard, in Pelham trapping backyards
I didn't even know 'bout Goyard (I didn't)
I just sent Mike a new bank card (Here you go)
Remembering days in the courtyard
I came from trapping at Nat's (At Natalie's)
Trapping with bugs in the trap (Ew)
She wanna spill all the facts (You do that)
Yeah, yeah
I cannot sit on my ass (I can't)
I gotta chase me a bag
My shooters think it's tag (Brrrah)
She wanna buy me a Jag'
BM text me, throw ten at her like Messi (Here you go, babe)
Take the Draco, please make it messy (Yeah)
Told Kilani I want grills like Nelly's (Uh-huh)
I was locked, no one answered their cellys (No one)
No change in my line, used my celly's
This TEC-9 hold many
Lucky told me don't trust many, gang
[Chorus: Drake]
The level is just too advanced
The bezel is Tiffany stamped
Don't grip on my hand
I know that I came with a slide from left to right, but now I don't wanna dance
I got too much on the line, too much on my mind, too much ain't enough for my plans
Nike don't pay me to tell you, "Just do it"
They pay me to show you I'll do it again

[Post-Chorus: Smiley]
Huh? Yeah
I'm in control of the block (Live)
You know how October get hot (You know)
Might make this glizzy go pop (Bang)
The crib is over the top (It is)
The whip is over the top (How?)
I thought about letting her go (I did)
But I wasn't over the top8Embed
