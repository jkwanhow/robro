Betrayal Lyrics[Intro]
Finish (Finish)
(​pinkgrillz)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Paper planes (Paper planes), Novocaine (Novocaine)
Mary Jane (Yeah)
Say one thing to me, you Texas toast, no Raising Cane's
I can't lie, life's good, man, I can't complain (Yeah)
Walkin' through the hood undoubtedly without a stain
Hopped off the porch, I'm a prodigy, they know the name
Had to run it up like my prophecy, financial gain (pinkgrillz)
If you ain't with me, you against me, then get out the way (Woah)
[Verse 1: Trippie Redd, Trippie Redd & Drake]
We be spinnin' on you and your people, dancin' on your grave
Keep them choppers like Resident Evil, we dress like BloodRaynе
Rocked out, American eaglе, hoodie got blood stains
And my brother whippin' up them kilos, I told him "Fuck the game"
Twin Glocks, Max Payne, kickin' shit, Johnny Cage
Ices out at Johnny Dang, beat shit, Liu Kang
Flamin' shit, Liu Kang, brand new day (pinkgrillz)
Brand new K, ballin' like 2K

[Verse 2: Drake]
I swear I been betrayed ('Trayed)
One too many times (Times)
Too many to count (Count), yeah
All them nights I prayed
Solid how I stayed (Stayed)
No matter how they played it, I still don't mind (Woah, yeah)
There's too many to count (Ayy, ayy, pinkgrillz)
Times I been betrayed, fuck is that about?
Paper plane, Laker game, Novocaine (Novocaine)
Head shot, Drizzy, man, you know the aim (Grrrt)
Niggas prayin' that I spare 'em like a bowling lane (Woo, woo)
Yeah, like Mike (Like Mike)
Corleone (Corleone), sporty flow (Sporty flow)
I done done it all, it's like I'm Shawty Lo (Shawty)
All these fools I'm beefin' that I barely know
Forty-five, forty-four (Burned out), let it go
Ye ain't changin' shit for me, it's set in stone
Rollin' stones, heavy stones (pinkgrillz)
Precious stone, let me make my presence known
[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Paper planes (Paper planes), Novocaine (Novocaine)
Mary Jane (Yeah)
Say one thing to me, you Texas toast, no Raising Cane's
I can't lie, life's good, man, I can't complain (Yeah)
Walkin' through the hood undoubtedly without a stain
Hopped off the porch, I'm a prodigy, they know the name
Had to run it up like my prophecy, financial gain (pinkgrillz)
If you ain't with me, you against me, then get out the way (Yeah)40Embed
